Hello there, let me begin by admitting that I have nothing to say and am at a loss for words to explain what is on my mind. No peace, and please don't dm or contact me because I don't need your aid with anything in my life. You were born alone, and you will die alone, and this world will simply place a lot of laws on top of you to force you to accept those facts. But I will never forget. I'm living my life as if there's no tomorrow, because there isn't.
